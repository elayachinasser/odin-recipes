        <p>The Brown family's pumpkin pie has a tasty walnut streusel topping that sets it apart from most traditional pumpkin pies. "There aren't enough stars for this pumpkin pie! I followed the recipe exactly and added two teaspoons of vanilla extract. Everyone raved about it! The streusel topping is incredible and the pie itself makes a great presentation," says reviewer Jillian.</p>

        <p>Skip the canned pumpkin pur√©e and use fresh pumpkin for this recipe. "This is the absolute best pumpkin pie ever! This was my first time making pumpkin pie with a pie pumpkin and I'll never go back to using canned pumpkin or buying a store-bought pumpkin pie ever again," says reviewer Jenny Atkinson.</p>
